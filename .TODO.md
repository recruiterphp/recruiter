```php
$memoryLimit = new Cli\Option\MemoryLimit('memory-limit', '32MB'),
$memoryLimit->enforce();
$supervisor = new Cli\Option\Supervisor('respawn', false),
$supervisor->applyTo($gracefulDeathBuilder)
// configure reanimaptionPolicy()
// configure avoidFutileMedicalCare() when respawn is true
```

* Take MongoDB coordinates from environment || default in tests/bootstrap.php
* Stop on Error for PHPUnit

* Make sure there is only one recruiter process (`RecruiterProcess::ensureIsAlone()`)
* Recruiter clean up after death `RecruiterProcess::cleanUp`
* Test `JobAfterFailure`

* Metric: number of job executed in unit of time (when job executed)
* Metric: number of job scheduled in unit of time (when job scheduled)
* Metric: average wait time for jobs in unit of time (when job executed)

* How to test `RetryPolicy` instances
* How to test `Workable` instances
* Port all previous retry policies

* Statistics/Metrics: look at what we have today

* Logging with Monolog
* Test for failure conditions
  * Worker should remove itself when it dies
  * GracefulDeath limit how many times a worker/recruiter could be resurrected

* Trace result execution in Recruiter\Job
  * Is there a package for pretty printing things?

* Keep track of how many job a worker has done
* Jobs will trace in `last_execution` of worker data
* Support job expiration

## Bugs
* Sometimes zombie workers have `$this->status === null`
  ```
  Warning: array_key_exists() expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in /home/coder/code/recruiter/src/Recruiter/Worker.php on line 105
  ```

## Questions
* Ask to Giorgio
  * Deadly Exceptions
  * Jobs knows retry_number/attempts
  * Jobs can depend on something? `($job->dependsOn)`
  * Why in `Field::pick` jobs are sorted by `new` field?


## Refactorings
* Refactoring: extract `Cli\Options` from `Cli` aka all things after parse
