  * [ ] So they could store also retriable exceptions
  * [ ] Port retry policies
* [ ] Exponential back-off for bin/recruiter and bin/worker
* [ ] Tagging jobs and `--work-on=<TAG>` for workers
* [ ] Deadly Exceptions
* [ ] Statistics/Metrics: look at what we have today

* [ ] Make sure when it starts that there are not other recruiter process on the same db
* [ ] Logging with Monolog
* [ ] Failure conditions
  * [ ] Cleanup on workers
  * [ ] GracefulDeath limit how many times a worker/recruiter could be resurrected
* [ ] Trace result execution in Recruiter\Job

* [ ] Keep track of how many job a worker has done
* [ ] Jobs will trace in `last_execution` of worker data
