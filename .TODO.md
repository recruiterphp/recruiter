* Persistent retry policies (Gabriele retry-policies)
  * Expose `Recruiter\Job\Failed` to `RetryPolicy`
  * Give `$exceptionThatCausedTheFailure` to `RetryPolicy::schedule`
  * Example where `RetryPolicy` could decide to retry based on exception
  * Port retry policies
  * Test, test, test :smile:

* Be able to execute first and schedule only if failed (Gabriele execute-before-schedule)

* Exponential back-off for bin/recruiter and bin/worker
* Tagging jobs and `--work-on=<TAG>` for workers
* Deadly Exceptions
* Statistics/Metrics: look at what we have today
* Jobs knows retry_number/attempts

* Make sure when it starts that there are not other recruiter process on the same db
* Logging with Monolog
* Test for failure conditions
  * Cleanup on workers
  * GracefulDeath limit how many times a worker/recruiter could be resurrected
* Trace result execution in Recruiter\Job

* Keep track of how many job a worker has done
* Jobs will trace in `last_execution` of worker data
* Support job expiration
