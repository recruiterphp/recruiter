* Story: trace result of job execution
* Story: when bin/recruiter start ensure is alone
* Story: when bin/recruiter start retire all dead workers
* Story: reschedule job assigned to worker when worker retire (`WorkerDiedMysteriously`)
* Story: port all previous retry policies
* Story: raise domain events and store them in `events` collection

* Test: bake a worker in a known status
* Test: bake a job in a known status
* Test: Take MongoDB coordinates from environment or keep default in tests/bootstrap.php
* Test: Stop on error for PHPUnit
* Test: `JobAfterFailure`
* Test: How to test `RetryPolicy` instances?
* Test: How to test `Workable` instances

* Metric: number of job executed in unit of time (when job executed)
* Metric: number of job scheduled in unit of time (when job scheduled)
* Metric: average wait time for jobs in unit of time (when job executed)

* Logging with Monolog
* Keep track of how many job a worker has done

## Endurance Test
* 10.000.000 jobs
  * `AlwaysFail` gracefully or violently
  * `SloppyDude` sometimes fails gracefully or violently
  * `LazyBones`
* bin/recruiter always takes the poison
* bin/worker and bin/recruiter started with `--respawn`
* all jobs must end up in `archive` collection

## Bugs
* Sometimes zombie workers have `$this->status === null`
  ```
  Warning: array_key_exists() expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in /home/coder/code/recruiter/src/Recruiter/Worker.php on line 105
  ```

## Questions
* Ask to Giorgio
  * Deadly Exceptions
  * Jobs knows retry_number/attempts
  * Jobs can depend on something? `($job->dependsOn)`
  * Why in `Field::pick` jobs are sorted by `new` field?


## Refactorings
* Refactoring: extract `Cli\Options` from `Cli` aka all things after parse
