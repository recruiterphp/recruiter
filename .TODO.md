$memoryLimit = new Cli\Option\MemoryLimit('memory-limit', '32MB'),
$supervisor = new Cli\Option\Supervisor('respawn', false),
$memoryLimit->enforce();
```

* Refactoring: extract `Cli\Options` from `Cli` aka all things after parse

* Check that `retriableExceptionTypes` are subclass of `Exception` in `RetriableExceptionFilter`
* Check that `causeOfFailure` is not null in `JobAfterFailure`
* Validate `JobToSchedule::taggedAs`

* How to test `RetryPolicy` instances
* How to test `Workable` instances
* Port all previous retry policies

* Make sure when it starts that there are not other recruiter process on the same db

* ??? Deadly Exceptions
* ??? Jobs knows retry_number/attempts
* ??? Jobs can depend on something? `($job->dependsOn)`
* ??? Why in `Field::pick` jobs are sorted by `new` field?

* Statistics/Metrics: look at what we have today

* Logging with Monolog
* Test for failure conditions
  * Worker should remove itself when it dies
  * GracefulDeath limit how many times a worker/recruiter could be resurrected

* Trace result execution in Recruiter\Job
  * Is there a package for pretty printing things?

* Keep track of how many job a worker has done
* Jobs will trace in `last_execution` of worker data
* Support job expiration
