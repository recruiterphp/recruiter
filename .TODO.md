* `JobToSchedule`
  * `taggedAs`
  * `expireAt(Moment)`
  * `scheduleIn(Duration)`
  * `scheduleAt(Moment)`
  * shortcut method for the most common retry policies

* Extract `JobExecution` from `Job`
  * It knows if it was a failure

* `JobAfterFailure($job, $lastJobExecution)`
  * `scheduleIn(Duration)`
  * `scheduleAt(Moment)`
  * `causeOfFailure()`
  * `attempts()`
  * `archive($why)`

* Example where `RetryPolicy` could decide to retry based on exception
* Port old retry policies

* Exponential back-off for bin/recruiter and bin/worker
* Tagging jobs and `--work-on=<TAG>` for workers
* Deadly Exceptions
* Statistics/Metrics: look at what we have today
* ??? Jobs knows retry_number/attempts

* Make sure when it starts that there are not other recruiter process on the same db
* Logging with Monolog
* Test for failure conditions
  * Worker should remove itself when it dies
  * GracefulDeath limit how many times a worker/recruiter could be resurrected
* Trace result execution in Recruiter\Job

* Keep track of how many job a worker has done
* Jobs will trace in `last_execution` of worker data
* Support job expiration
